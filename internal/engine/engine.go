// It orchestrates turn processing, campaign management, and state queries.

// All operations are keyed by campaignID; the engine must behave correctly
// even if LoadCampaign has never been called for that ID. Implementations
// may use LoadCampaign as an optional optimization (for example, to warm
// caches or load campaign data into memory), but callers are not required
// to invoke it before calling ProcessTurn or GetGameState.
//
// For all methods that accept a campaignID, implementations should return a
// suitable error (e.g. "campaign not found") if the referenced campaign does
// not exist.
