# Phase 9: Showcase Features

> 20 issues across 2 tracks. Replay mode and campaign export — features that let players share, archive, and relive their campaigns.
> Created: 2026-04-04

## Phase Entry Criteria

Phase 8 complete: journal view with session summaries working, auth functional, audio system operational. (**Required.**)

## Phase Exit Criteria

- Replay mode plays back any campaign turn-by-turn with controls
- Campaign export produces PDF, markdown transcript, character sheet, and JSON dump
- All exports downloadable from the frontend

---

## Sprint 1: Replay Mode

### Track A: Campaign Replay

> Read-only playback of completed or in-progress campaigns.
> Depends on: Session history endpoint (already exists)

## Sprint 2: Campaign Export

### Track B: Export System

> Multi-format export: JSON data dump, markdown transcript, character sheet, styled PDF.
> Depends on: Journal summaries (Phase 8 Track C) for PDF story section

| #   | Issue                                                            | Title                                          | Size | Blocker   | Model  | Notes                            |

**Phase 9 total: 14 issues (plus 6 from earlier numbering = 20 total). Two clean sprints, both highly parallelizable.**

## Phase Summary

This is the final planned phase. After Phase 9, the project has:

- Intelligent tool filtering reducing LLM cognitive load
- Spoiler-safe information panels (NPCs, relationships, facts, codex, map)
- Full rules engine with narrative/light/crunch modes
- Dedicated combat UI
- Time/calendar system
- Save/resume/restart
- XP and leveling with feats and skills
- Streaming typewriter narrative
- Ambient audio with controls
- Thinking indicators with context
- Session journal with auto-summaries
- Multi-user authentication
- Campaign replay mode
- Multi-format campaign export

**Total issues across Phases 5-9: ~200 sub-issues from 24 epics.**
